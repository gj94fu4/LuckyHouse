    How should I begin writing about Ura-Tsurugi (Back Side of Tsurugi)? No matter what words I use, it feels impossible to fully capture the beauty of this journey. Even so, I feel the urge to jot something down. Through words and photos, I want to relive the magic of those days.
    <br><br>
    I’m reminded of a quote by Kōtarō Sawaki: “<i>Travel is not a repetition, nor can it be repeated.</i>” If it can’t be repeated, then all we can do is hold onto it in our hearts and occasionally revisit those memories. Months have passed since I returned, and it feels like the right time to give form to those recollections. I’ve titled this piece “Crossing the Horizon of Immortal Realm.” which could also mean “Venturing into a Hidden Domain.” Ura-Tsurugi’s hidden sanctuary is unforgettable, not only for its stunning landscapes but also for the camaraderie of the team. The warmth of our shared experience made me feel as though we had the blessing of a hermit himself.
    <br><br>
    Everything began with that quaint email.
    <br><br>
    It was a scorching late-July day. The sun was blazing, causing the air outside the window to ripple and the distant mountains to shimmer. Inside the air-conditioned office, it was the usual cool and dry. Even when thunder roared and torrential rain poured in the afternoon, the people at their desks remained unfazed, absorbed in their daily tasks.
    <br><br>
    And then, I received an unread email in my inbox.
    <br><br>
    The sender was Terry, and the subject line read, “<i>Ura-Tsurugi, Chōjirō-dani, Hayatsuki-one.</i>” At first glance, I had no idea what the email was about, but since it was from Terry, I figured it must be an invitation for a mountain expedition. Upon closer inspection, I realized the place names weren’t in Taiwan but in Japan. Curious, I opened the email to find details of a mountaineering adventure with the meeting point in Kanazawa, Japan. The email outlined the itinerary for each day, with participants responsible for booking their flights and accommodations. The catch? We only had one month to prepare.
    <br><br>
    The recipient list showed just me and Ariel. Was it just us two? Or perhaps there was already a larger team, and we were late additions. It made sense that I wasn’t initially included — I’d only climbed with Terry a handful of times, and our relationship wasn’t deep. But Ariel had been Terry’s mountaineering partner for over a decade; it seemed unusual not to invite her from the beginning.
    <br><br>
    With lingering questions, I decided to join. Time quickly flew by as the sweltering summer days of late August approached.
    <br>

    </div><br>
    As mentioned in the subject line, the route for this expedition was divided into three sections.
    <br><br>
    <ul>
      <li>
        From Kurobe Gorge to Ura-Tsurugi
        <br>
        Unlike the typical route starting from Murodō, which traverses meadows and cirques, this path ascends from Sennin-dani (Sennin Valley), crosses a mountain pass, and descends into Tsurugi-sawa (Tsurugi River). It promises diverse landscapes, including streams, gorges, and forests.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        Ascending Tsurugi-dake via Chōjirō-dani
        <br>
        This route holds historical significance as it was the path taken by the Land Survey Department’s team, led by Shibazaki Yoshitaro and Uji Chōjirō, over a century ago. They successfully summited Tsurugi-dake (Mount Tsurugi) and conducted surveys that were later immortalized in Jirō Nitta’s novel <i>Tsurugidake: Ten no Ki</i> and its film adaptation by Daisaku Kimura.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        Descending via Hayatsuki-one
        <br>
        Though less renowned, Hayatsuki-one (Hayatsuki Ridge) offers challenging and captivating terrain. Its long stretches and significant elevation changes promise to test one’s endurance even after leaving Tsurugi-dake.
        <br><br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    I was particularly excited about the Chōjirō-dani (Chōjirō Valley) segment and eagerly awaited the day of departure. I obsessively read expedition reports and was especially concerned about the melting snowfields, as crevasses and impassable steps could form. This year’s summer heatwave only heightened my worries. However, just two weeks before our departure, a team summited Tsurugi-dake via Chōjirō-dani without using ropes, boosting our confidence.
    <br><br>
    Finally, the long-awaited day arrived. We boarded a plane and landed on Japan’s pristine coastline.
    <br><br>

    </div><br>
    Returning to Kanazawa after eight years, I was greeted by the familiar sight of the Tsuzumi Gate. Taking a deep breath, I felt an overwhelming sense of relief. The past three years of the COVID-19 pandemic had brought countless changes, both in the world and in my own life. Despite these shifts, I was fortunate to be surrounded by understanding friends who joined me in adventures that satisfied my boundless curiosity.
    <br><br>
    Although we planned the trek together, we arranged our travel to Japan separately. Terry and Berny, who had prior commitments, had already booked flights to Komatsu. Coincidentally, I ended up on the same flight as them, and we traveled together to Kanazawa. Ariel arrived half a day earlier, exploring the city and visiting outdoor gear shops with Alan, who was there on a family trip.
    <br><br>
    That evening, Ariel, Alan, and I dined at a well-rated ramen shop near the station, toasting with large mugs of beer. Wandering through the gentle evening breeze of a foreign land, briefly forgetting the worries of daily life, was a cherished experience.
    <br><br>
    Little did we know that a small seed was quietly taking root within us — a story destined to grow under the moonlight and through our shared sweat.
