    On a typical weekday morning, Unazuki was unusually quiet. Most shops hadn’t opened yet, and the streets were eerily empty. The atmosphere reminded me of Wulai, New Taipei, especially with the surrounding mountains. I wanted to take a leisurely stroll, but Terry urged us to buy tickets for the next leg of our journey. We still had half an hour before departure, and I thought Terry was being overly cautious. However, upon entering the station, I was surprised to find the hall already packed with people in line.
    <br><br>
    With Ariel and Berny, both fluent in Japanese, leading the way, buying tickets was a breeze. In fact, booking mountain huts and checking real-time trail conditions were also made easy thanks to them. Terry, like me, doesn’t speak Japanese, but he took on the heavy responsibility of planning the itinerary and researching information. Among the four of us, I contributed the least. In recent years, I’ve become accustomed to following along without much input.
    <br><br>
    After the pandemic began, I met Justin, who was actively inviting people to complete Baiyue (the 100 Peaks) of Taiwan. All I had to do was set aside time and wait for the plan, occasionally suggesting routes I wanted to explore. Later, I met Pei, Yi-hua, and Misha. They always found fun itineraries, making hiking more than just a point-to-point march to the summit. They embraced nature fully — doing yoga, meditating, drawing, or simply lying down, sitting, chatting, or being silent — making one feel part of the universe. Then I met Terry, who often proposed routes I’d never heard of, usually unmarked or secondary paths. They weren’t necessarily far, difficult, or time-consuming, but they were always filled with stories and mystery. Sometimes, we’d trek through mud or cut through dense vegetation just to see a dilapidated retaining wall or a hidden mine in a valley. Despite the different hiking styles with various people, whether fast or slow, I felt comfortable entrusting myself to them. We could share joyful moments and overcome challenges together. As a result, I became increasingly reliant and less inclined to handle the tedious preparatory work of route planning. Fortunately, everyone was accommodating, allowing me to be a “freeloader” without pressure.

    As a dedicated freeloader, I hadn’t researched the origins of the Kurobe Gorge Railway before the trip. It wasn’t until long after returning home that I did some homework for this record. The railway was initially constructed after World War I by Nippon Electric Power Company to develop hydroelectric resources in the middle reaches of the Kurobe River, meeting the post-war industrial demand for electricity. After World War II, the company dissolved, and the railway changed hands several times before Kansai Electric Power Company took over. Eventually, the section from Unazuki to Keyakidaira, known as the “Lower Track” and operational before World War II, was developed into a passenger tourist route. In 2013, it became a sister railway to the Alishan Forest Railway of Taiwan, even offering reciprocal ticketing promotions.

    The Kurobe Gorge Railway offers different seating options. We chose the open-air cars at the front of the train. While they have canopies for shade, the cars only have benches and railings, with safety chains more symbolic than functional — much like amusement park rides. Since it was summer with cool, dry weather, riding in the open-air cars was enjoyable. However, in winter or rain, it might be less pleasant. The rear cars are enclosed, protecting passengers from the elements, but viewing the scenery through windows might lessen the experience.

    With a sharp whistle piercing the quiet spa town, the locomotive roared to life, emitting a deep rumble. The train swayed as it slowly navigated multiple switches, passing through rough, narrow, dark tunnels. Crossing the crimson Shin-Yamabiko Bridge over the Kurobe River, people along the shore paused their work to wave enthusiastically at the train. With mixed feelings of anticipation and reluctance, we bid farewell to Unazuki Onsen, embarking on our journey into the Kurobe Gorge.
    <br><br>
    Although it’s a tourist railway, traces of its industrial past are evident everywhere. The Kurobe Gorge Railway never ceased its industrial transport role; it’s still vital for Kansai Electric Power Company to maintain the dams and power plants along the Kurobe River. After crossing the Shin-Yamabiko Bridge, we soon reached Yanagibashi Station above the Unazuki Dam. This isn’t a tourist stop but a hub for personnel and materials for the Shin-Yanagihara Power Plant, so the train slowed down but didn’t stop. Before reaching Keyakidaira, we passed the Dashidaira Dam, Kurobe River No. 2 Power Plant, and Koyadaira Dam. These places have no other access routes, highlighting the railway’s crucial role. There are two stations where tourists can disembark: Kuro-nagi Station at the confluence of the Kuro-nagi River, where visitors can hike to Kuro-nagi Onsen, Kuro-nagi No. 2 Power Plant, and Kita-mata Valley, or cross the Koedo Pass to return to the Kurobe Plain. The other is Kanetsuri Station, near Miyama and Kanetsuri Onsens, with mountain lodges available. Unfortunately, our goal wasn’t railway tourism this time, so we couldn’t explore each stop in depth.
    <br><br>
    As for the scenery along the way, it closely resembles Taiwan’s Taroko Gorge. However, the Liwu River in Taroko is shorter and steeper than the Kurobe River, with rapid terrain changes from downstream to midstream. The Kurobe River’s changes are more gradual, transitioning from open gravel beaches to vertical cliffs over tens of kilometers, making it ideal for leisurely observation from the train.

    The train ride lasted just over an hour — not too long, but after enduring the deafening noise and occasional violent shaking, there was an undeniable sense of relief when we finally arrived at the terminus, Keyakidaira. Although we felt reluctant for the ride to end, the sensation of stepping off the train was liberating. Compared to the “seemingly impassable” landscapes we passed along the way, the bustling activity of railway workers at Keyakidaira felt like a surprising oasis — a “hidden village beyond the bamboo grove.” As the train emptied, the small station building quickly filled with noise and chatter, but the crowd dissipated just as fast. Before long, the spacious square in front of the station returned to its peaceful state.
    <br><br>
    I bought a croquette and iced coffee from a vendor at the station, treating it as a ceremonial breakfast before heading into the mountains. Terry and Berny, however, leaned leisurely on the railing by the square, watching the return trains pass by. Ariel mentioned that she had visited this area a few years ago after a hiking trip. She even stayed overnight at the nearby Baba-dani (Baba Valley) Onsen, which left me feeling a bit envious. For this trip, I had planned to spend a few days exploring the Noto Peninsula after descending the mountain, but everyone else was heading back home the next day. It was unfortunate that we didn’t have more time to travel together. While traveling alone offers freedom to do whatever you want at any moment, having companions to share the scenery and encounters along the way creates memories that become irreplaceable parts of each other’s lives. For me, such shared experiences are precious and impossible to let go of.

    I think the idea of freedom and constraint isn’t solely about whether one is bound by rules or obligations, but whether the desires of one’s heart are fulfilled.
