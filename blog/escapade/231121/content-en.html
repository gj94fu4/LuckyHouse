    Embarking on a hike with Terry is usually straightforward, but this time was different. At the trailhead, we leisurely enjoyed the cool breeze wafting from the depths of the valley, seemingly oblivious to time. Only after the crowds had dispersed did we set off, fully content. As we approached the trail entrance at the edge of the plaza, Terry took the lead, confidently ascending the steep steps. I, bringing up the rear, gazed upward at the path winding through the dark green forest, struck by a sense of familiarity.

    Shortly after entering the trail, we encountered two gentlemen who appeared to be trail volunteers. After exchanging greetings and mentioning we were from Taiwan, one of them informed us that the owner of the Asohara Onsen Hut was eagerly awaiting our visit. Perhaps foreign visitors are rare on this trail, and with another Taiwanese group having passed through less than a month ago, we left a strong impression. Regardless, the owner’s enthusiasm seemed to have traveled the length of the Kurobe Gorge, guiding us toward a pleasant and memorable journey.

    As we ascended, the air grew drier. The trees and grass along the path, despite being far from developed areas, didn’t seem particularly tall. The sun blazed overhead, and the wind had ceased, leaving us drenched in sweat within minutes. I lowered my head, watching large beads of sweat drip from my forehead to the ground, while smaller droplets traced paths along my eyes, nose, and lips, forming tiny streams. Tasting the salty moisture, I was reminded of hiking in the Taroko Gorge. Many online sources compare the Kurobe Suihei Trail to the Zhuilu Old Trail in Taroko, noting the similar experience of walking along cliff edges. Indeed, in the sweltering summer heat, the immediate profuse sweating linked the two in my mind. However, I was reluctant to make such comparisons, as my knowledge of both Taroko and Kurobe was limited. I hoped to “reset,” as Professor Jian Hongmo suggested, setting aside past experiences and biases to fully embrace the new environment. This approach would allow me to truly understand the natural and cultural significance behind the scenery.

    After climbing the final section of the ingeniously designed adjustable iron ladder, a breeze rustled the treetops and cooled our overheated skin. We paused at a viewpoint on the ridge, overlooking the Sarutobi Gorge, as Terry pointed out distant peaks like Tengu-no-atama (Mount Tengu's Summit) and Karamatsu-dake (Mount Karamatsu). From Keyakidaira to this point, we had ascended about 250 meters. Continuing south along the ridge for another 100 meters brought us to the Suihei Trail.

    The so-called Suihei Trail was carved out during Japan Electric Power Company’s explorations before the construction of the Kurobe Gorge Railway. However, in the “<i>Yama to Kōgen Chizu</i>” (<i>Maps of Mountains and Plateaus</i>) published by Shōbunsha, only the section from Keyakidaira to Sennin-dani is labeled as the Suihei Trail, while the segment from Sennin-dani to the Kurobe Dam is referred to as the “Old Nippon Electric Power Trail.” In reality, both sections should be considered part of the Old Nippon Electric Power Trail. The name “Suihei Trail” likely derives from its route along the contour lines, resulting in minimal elevation change. Geographically, the upper and middle reaches of the Kurobe River Gorge were praised by mountaineer Katsumata Jirō in the Meiji era as the “Great Corridor Gorge,” with “corridor” referring to a deep valley flanked by cliffs. Subsequently, the gorge was divided into four sections: Oku-no-Rōka, Kami-no-Rōka, Naka-no-Rōka, and Shimo-no-Rōka. The Suihei Trail and Old Nippon Electric Power Trail are located in Shimo-no-Rōka, while Naka-no-Rōka is now submerged under the reservoir formed by the Kurobe Dam.

    The Suihei Trail clings to the rock face, but it’s not entirely on solid ground. Crossing gullies or protruding rocks often requires suspended walkways. Occasionally, a turn reveals a sheer drop beneath your feet. These walkways and bridges are mostly temporary structures, dismantled each winter before the snow arrives. This is why the trail is closed during winter and only opens after Kansai Electric Power Company personnel have inspected and repaired it in the summer. Even during our summer visit, we encountered several suspended operations, indicating the significant time, manpower, and resources required annually to maintain the trail. Despite the yearly construction, there’s no attempt to create permanent solutions. Instead, the approach is to adapt to nature, addressing each challenge with care. Attention to detail is evident: wire ends are wrapped with tape, protruding nails are clipped, and sharp edges are smoothed to prevent injury. There’s no cutting corners that could compromise safety. Walking this path, one feels that the goal is to “do it well,” not just “get it done.” This thoughtful consideration is truly moving. When the mountains and trails are managed as personal assets, travelers can feel genuinely welcomed.

    We discussed the topic of installing bidet toilets in public restrooms in Taipei. In Japan, it’s common for public restrooms to have bidet toilets, a practice that’s been in place for years. I’ve used them many times myself. However, implementing the same idea in Taiwan seems far-fetched. Some cite hygiene concerns, others point to maintenance difficulties, and some believe that public etiquette in Taiwan hasn’t reached Japan’s level. Regardless, if everyone treated public facilities as their own, keeping them clean, and if those responsible for maintenance managed them with care — rather than leaving floors wet and slippery — one might wonder: can we not achieve what Japan has? Instead of focusing solely on superficial achievements, do we sufficiently value each individual’s sense of belonging to this environment and society?

    Engrossed in conversation, we covered a considerable distance. Accompanied by the towering 800-meter-high, majestic, and renowned rock face of Okujōyama’s (Mount Okujō's) western wall, we passed through Keyaki-dani (Keyaki Valley) and Shijimi-dani (Shijimi Valley). The number of suspension bridges decreased, and the trail became wider and more solid. The path on the other side of the mountain fold was so clear that it was astonishing, with hikers appearing minuscule in comparison. Arriving at Shiai-dani (Shiai Valley), a check dam blocked our way. Terry and Berny stopped by the grass near the creek, seemingly observing something. Approaching, I was surprised to find the entrance to a tunnel. It was then that I realized that crossing the river didn’t involve wading but passing through the tunnel beneath the check dam! The entrance, supported by wooden frames, was less than adult height. A cold wind blew from within, and the sound of trickling water was refreshingly cool. In the pitch darkness, it felt like another world. We bent down and followed Terry into the tunnel. When the headlamp illuminated the rock walls, tiny stars sparkled all the way to the end — ice crystals! The walls were covered in white frost, leaving us in awe and exclaiming in surprise.

    Shortly after passing Shiai-dani, we encountered a series of paths carved into vertical rock faces, known as “Ōdaiko.” This is perhaps the most iconic and thrilling section of the Suihei Trail. The carved path is roughly the height of an adult and less than 50 centimeters wide, so everyone had to crouch carefully while moving forward, wary of bumping their heads or, worse, losing balance and falling to their doom. In reality, the inner side of the cliff has very secure steel cables to hold onto, making the route less dangerous than it visually appears.

    Compared to the temporary trail facilities that are dismantled yearly, the permanent bolts, steel cables, and chains embedded into the rock on Japanese popular hiking routes are quite common. This is in stark contrast to Taiwan, where ropes are still the predominant safety feature on most trails. Observing Japanese hikers, it’s clear they have a strong sense of safety awareness. Even on seemingly simple routes, most hikers wear helmets. On riskier sections like Ōdaiko, many will also attach carabiners to the steel cables for additional security. Reflecting on my own past hiking experiences, I rarely wore a helmet and almost never brought equipment like carabiners or harnesses. Witnessing the cautious and methodical approach of Japanese hikers firsthand always leaves me feeling humbled. I believe the greatest difference between hiking in Japan and Taiwan lies in this careful, step-by-step spirit and the attitude of prioritizing safety over speed or convenience. By refusing to take shortcuts or gamble with their safety, hikers can ensure they’ll continue to enjoy the mountains for years to come.

    Following the steady steps of the Japanese hikers ahead of us, we crossed the final wooden suspension bridge. The Asohara Onsen Hut was now just within sight. The hut’s owner, Mr. Izumi Sasaki, sporting a vibrant Hawaiian shirt and a head of stylish white hair, leaned out from the second-floor window, beaming as he warmly welcomed us to his lodge.
