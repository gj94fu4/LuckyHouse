    Apart from Mount Fuji, this was my first experience staying in a Japanese mountain hut. Asohara Onsen Hut didn’t match the grandiose image I had in mind, but it was distinctly different from mountain huts in Taiwan — especially since it’s rare to find huts in Taiwan that are professionally managed. At the entrance, we unloaded our gear and changed into indoor slippers. As Mr. Sasaki introduced the hut’s facilities, house rules, hot spring, and meal times, we discreetly observed how the Japanese guests adhered to mountain etiquette.

    The thought of soaking in a hot spring on the first night filled me with indescribable joy! In Taiwan, during multi-day hikes, especially in mid-to-high altitude areas far from civilization, it’s rare to have the chance to enjoy a hot bath. Even when there’s a wild hot spring, it often requires building a makeshift pool with stones and redirecting water — an exhausting task that doesn’t always guarantee satisfaction. Asohara’s hot spring is just a five-minute walk down the stairs from the hut. The water source comes from a nearby high-temperature cave, with a man-made soaking pool equipped with benches and washbasins, almost reaching the standard of urban public baths. Due to different time slots for men and women, Terry and I went first, while Ariel and Berny stayed in the room to organize their gear, planning to switch after the hour.

    After bathing and soaking, the day’s stickiness and fatigue were completely washed away. The concept of “cumulative fatigue” often mentioned during long hikes in Taiwan seemed irrelevant after a hot bath. I bought a large can of Sapporo draft beer and headed to the dining area, hoping to eavesdrop on Mr. Sasaki and his friends’ conversation. However, not understanding Japanese, I turned to the bookshelf and picked up books about mountaineering in the Tsurugi-dake area and the history of Tateyama and Kurobe. Although I couldn’t read Japanese, the photos and data provided some insight. In the corner of the dining area, a LCD TV displayed news programs and local weather forecasts in split-screen mode. Later, I noticed that every mountain hut used the same system, allowing hikers to stay updated on nearby weather conditions and adjust their plans accordingly.

    As dusk settled, those who had been soaking in the hot spring returned one after another. We arrived at Asohara around 4 PM, and it was soon time for dinner. There weren’t many guests staying in the hut that night. Besides our group of four, there were only two other pairs staying indoors; the rest were camping outside, making the interior feel particularly spacious. Mr. Sasaki prepared a sumptuous dinner, including fried fish fillets, croquettes, sautéed mushrooms, fried burdock, stir-fried pork with onions, shredded cabbage, chilled tofu, cold noodles, and a large bowl of rice. Just looking at it was enough to make one feel full! As we pondered where to start, Mr. Sasaki playfully peeked out from the kitchen, turned off the news, and played a CD featuring a documentary about Asohara Onsen Hut. The host led the camera to the hut from a few years ago, and Mr. Sasaki’s familiar, friendly smile appeared on screen, eliciting exclamations from everyone. In the video, Mr. Sasaki recounted his younger days leading a team to develop the Kumokiri Shindō (Kumokiri New Trail) — a shortcut from the Sennin-dani Dam to Sennin Pond, which we planned to take the next day. He also mentioned that he returns annually to maintain the trails in the Kurobe Gorge. It was then we learned that Asohara Onsen Hut isn’t open year-round; it’s dismantled before winter to prevent damage from snow. The hut’s components are stored in a cave, awaiting reassembly the following summer into the structure we now see.
    <br><br>
    Beyond managing Asohara Onsen Hut, Mr. Sasaki served in the Toyama Prefecture Mountain Rescue Team for over a decade, specializing in mountain accident prevention and participating in numerous rescue missions. In 2019, he received the “Minister of the Environment Award for Contributions to Natural Parks,” recognizing his significant efforts in exploring and promoting the Tateyama-Kurobe mountain area. He stated, “<i>If more people can leave here moved and happy, everyone will become happier. Therefore, to achieve this goal, I believe I can continue to do something for this place.</i>” Mr. Sasaki’s deep connection to nature and care for travelers made us feel a sense of hospitality that far exceeded expectations, as if walking in these mountains granted us infinite blessings.

    As the program concluded and everyone was satiated, we returned to our room, still reminiscing about the day’s experiences. Our minds and stomachs were full. If overeating prevents one from lying down to sleep, does a heart full of beautiful memories make it hard to say goodbye? When the lights went out and the moonlight illuminated the land outside the window, I lay in the warm bed, reluctant to close my eyes.
