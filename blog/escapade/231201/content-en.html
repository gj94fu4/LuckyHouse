    After a restful night, I awoke to a bright morning. Perhaps due to the hot bath the previous evening, I felt completely relaxed. Noticing Ariel’s bed was empty, I tiptoed past the still-sleeping Terry and Berny, toothbrush in hand, and headed to the wash area. In the common room, I found Ariel warming her hands with a hot water bottle tucked inside her dark red down jacket. The lodge owner, Mr. Sasaki, busy in the kitchen, greeted me with a spirited “Good morning” upon hearing our voices.
    <br><br>
    I don’t recall exactly what we had for breakfast, but I remember leaving the table with a full stomach. As we prepared to depart Asohara Onsen Hut, the sun had yet to reach the valley, but Mr. Sasaki and his wife stood outside to see us off until we were out of sight.

    Asohara Onsen Hut sits about 100 meters below the Suihei (Horizontal) Trail, so we immediately faced a series of steep ascents upon departure. The path was pleasant, with deep green forests and moss-covered rocks reminiscent of Yangmingshan in Taiwan. Unlike the previous day’s exposed rocky cliffs, the route from Asohara to Sennin-dani was lush with vegetation, mitigating the sense of exposure. However, after passing through the low tunnel at Gongen Pass, the sudden cliffside view quickly dispelled any morning drowsiness. Shortly into the final descent, Terry and Berny stopped at an abrupt turn, peering at something. As I approached, a piercing “chirp” echoed between them — a massive cicada rested in Terry’s hand!
    <br><br>
    At the base of the descent, the terrain flattened into open grasslands, replacing the forest. The sky and surrounding mountains unfolded before us. I lifted my head, inhaling the scent of fresh grass and relaxing my eyes to embrace the bright vista. Across the distant valley, the towering “Kumokiri Falls” glistened like a strand of golden silk in the sunlight. As I refocused, I noticed dew-laden grass underfoot, each step on the damp earth producing a soft “squelch.” We paused, marveling at the diverse array of unfamiliar plants. Throughout our journey, the flora had been gentle and supple, contrasting with Taiwan’s often thorny, abrasive, and face-slapping vegetation. It seemed the character of plants mirrored that of the people. Does the environment shape the traits of its inhabitants? Or does the natural landscape influence a nation’s character? We also noticed the scarcity of wildlife and even bird calls. Could it be that Japanese animals, like the people, are more reserved and prefer tranquility?

    </div><br>
    Pondering these baseless speculations, we ventured deeper into the grassland, where a massive building appeared on our right — the “Kansai Electric Hitomi-daira Dormitory” marked on our map. I had assumed it was a cluster of abandoned brick houses, so seeing a towering reinforced concrete structure deep in the mountains, with illuminated corridors and stairwells and smoke rising from a sizable kitchen, was astonishing. Built against the mountain, the dormitory seemed embedded in the cliff, as if the interior connected directly to the mountain’s core. We tried peering through ventilation windows at the base but saw only grayish-white walls resembling a sewer. It appeared to be a construction tunnel corridor, offering no further clues.
    <br><br>

    </div><br>
    At the grassland’s end, the ground was overtaken by weed-covered abandoned tracks, with no path forward. As we hesitated, a worker in a power plant uniform passed through a fenced-off tunnel, catching our attention. A sign on the door indicated that the trail continued through the tunnel; hikers had to open and close the door themselves, traversing the power plant’s internal passage to reach the next segment. “This is so fascinating!” I couldn’t help but exclaim inwardly, gawking like a country bumpkin at the tunnel’s features.
    <br><br>
    After a brief rest at the gate, we entered the tunnel. The right passage likely led to the dormitory area, while the left headed toward the old electric trail and Kumokiri Shindō. We took the left path, initially enjoying the cool, comfortable air and the vintage feel of the mottled walls, as if stepping into a movie set. However, as we progressed, a wave of sulfurous heat hit us, with signs of corrosion on the walls. Steam even hissed from cracks and pipe joints, indicating we were passing through a geothermal zone. Further ahead, at a fork, we were amazed by the complex network of tunnels within the mountain, far beyond what tourists typically see. Some passages had tracks for trains, and a large enclosed iron bridge spanned the Kurobe River, leaving us in awe.
    <br><br>

    </div><br>
    Walking on the railway bridge, windows on both sides offered views: a deep gorge with rapids on one side and the magnificent Sennin-dani Dam on the other. A station, Sennin-dani, sat at the bridge’s center. I later learned this was the “Upper Track”, which was known as the “Kurobe Industrial Railway.” A timetable was posted on the wall, though its accuracy was uncertain. It’s said that next year, the Upper Track will open for tourism, allowing passengers to transfer at the terminal “Kurobe River No. 4 Power Plant” to a bus running through tunnels to the Kurobe Dam, connecting to the Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route.
    <br><br>
    Suddenly, alarms blared in the tunnel, red warning lights spinning rapidly. The “Caution: Train” signs weren’t mere decorations; a train was approaching. As the screech of steel grew louder and the dark tunnel illuminated, Ariel exclaimed, “This is sooooo cool!” I shared her excitement —
    <br><br>
    Tears of joy nearly welled up……
    <br><br>

    </div><br>
    The railway crossed the river directly in front of the Sennin-dani Dam, entering the mountain on the right bank of the Kurobe River. Meanwhile, we had to follow the left bank up a tributary, Sennin Creek, for a short distance before crossing over to the Kumokiri Ridge. Saying goodbye to the iron bridge, we continued walking through the power plant tunnels, only to unexpectedly find ourselves in what seemed to be a restricted office space. The mix of caution and boldness reminded me of my previous duties in Hawaii, where, due to the lack of restrooms at the observatory, I had to sneak into the neighboring NOAA building. Late at night, I often found myself exploring their mysterious, deserted corridors.
    <br><br>
    Following the signs, we pushed open a metal door at the end of the corridor, and the sudden burst of fresh air was an exhilarating surprise. As we looked around, we realized we had unknowingly ascended to the top of the dam. I left the group behind and walked toward the center of the dam, leaning over the railing to gaze down at the sheer, smooth cliffs on both sides of the valley. Slowly, I lifted my gaze upward until the vanishing point disappeared into the distant mountains. Then, I turned to the upstream side, where a vast, emerald-green reservoir mirrored the surrounding peaks. The sense of serenity was indescribable. I continued to the other side of the dam and back again, while Terry stayed with Berny and Ariel, leading them up to a rooftop platform by the dam to take in the view.
    <br><br>

    </div><br>
    Following the signs, I climbed an iron ladder to the rooftop platform, the starting point for Kumokiri Shindō. To my astonishment, the platform’s edge had no safety measures—no railings, no warning signs. Below the several-story drop was the seemingly bottomless reservoir. Yet everything felt so natural, as if recognizing and avoiding danger were innate instincts.
    <br><br>
    “Isn’t that how it should be?” I wondered.
    <br><br>
    Or perhaps we have been so sheltered in a well-tended greenhouse, relying on boundaries drawn by others, that we’ve lost our sensitivity to risks in nature and life? Reflecting on my own experiences growing up, I realized that anything deemed dangerous by society was often banned outright. There was no effort to educate, explore, or even acknowledge the existence of danger, let alone learn how to mitigate and overcome it. This blanket prohibition has repeatedly deprived us of growth opportunities, leaving us with little ability to discern risks for ourselves.
    <br><br>
    I once shared my thoughts on social media about this experience of walking through the everyday world of a power plant, lamenting that such opportunities are rare in Taiwan. A veteran in the field responded, explaining that in rural communities and under the jurisdiction of local authorities, it’s difficult to hold anyone accountable for tourists’ safety. As a result, risk factors and visitors are strictly separated. In contrast, both in Japan and other countries I’ve traveled to, the concept of “taking responsibility for one’s own safety” (e.g. “your safety, your responsibility”) has become a societal consensus. Learning and training before engaging in risky activities is considered essential. In mountaineering, for example, this includes learning to read maps and local signs, understanding the threats posed by climate and natural environments, using gear and technology to adapt to the wild, and following safety protocols in specific areas. These are all aspects worth promoting and implementing. As I mentioned earlier about safety awareness, I believe we still have much to learn from Japan. Only with thorough preparation can we access a broader range of experiences and not be excluded from exciting opportunities.

    The sunlight gradually illuminated the bottom of the valley. I cast one last look back at the dam, knowing it was time to move on. We descended from the rooftop platform on the opposite side, hugging the damp cliffs where Sennin Creek converged. At a narrow point in the river, we crossed a bamboo bridge, pausing to fill a large bottle with cool creek water. Refreshed, we set off on yet another long, steep ascent.
