    Our destination on the second day was Sennin-ike (Sennin Pond) Hut, situated at an elevation of 2,100 meters. Starting from the Sennin-dani Dam, at less than 900 meters, we had to climb over 1,200 meters of elevation in a single day — hardly an easy task. Yet even now, I find it surprising that I have no memory of hardship, either during or after the hike. I can’t help but wonder: was the journey simply too smooth, or was the joy we experienced along the way so overwhelming that it erased the struggle of each step?

    </div><br>
    The most vivid memory I have of Kumokiri Shindō is the initial series of ropes and iron ladders. Several massive rock formations along the ridge create dramatic vertical drops that would be nearly impossible to climb without artificial aids. Compared to the crumbly slopes in Taiwan, however, the geology and vegetation here felt much more dependable. By Japanese safety standards, the appearance of iron ladders seemed perfectly reasonable. Climbing the ladders enabled us to ascend rapidly. Before we knew it, we were far above the streambed, looking down at the glistening silver snake of the river curling along the verdant slopes. This section, called the “S-curve Gorge,” is one of the most iconic features of Shimo-no-Rōka.
    <br><br>
    From the hillside, we could clearly see two large concrete tunnel entrances on the opposite mountain, belonging to the Kurobe River No. 4 Power Plant. Thick high-voltage cables emerged from the tops of the tunnels, snaked around a hillside pylon, and wound their way along both banks of the gorge, delivering power to the densely populated plains, bringing light and convenience to countless households.

    </div><br>
    After the iron ladders, the view gradually disappeared, replaced by dense forests and steep switchbacks. Midway up, we encountered two descending hikers who praised our chosen route. Over the past two days, every hiker we met, including Mr. Sasaki from Asohara Onsen Hut, expressed admiration for our ambitious itinerary, noting the effort required to ascend from Kurobe Gorge to Sennin Pond. According to the hiking records I had reviewed before the trip, most people approaching Ura-Tsurugi take the easier route from Tsurugi-sawa, passing Sennin Pond to connect with Kumokiri Shindō. This approach minimizes uphill climbs and is less physically demanding. In contrast, our reverse route demanded far more uphill effort. However, given the steepness of certain sections, descending Kumokiri Shindō might not be as easy as it seems. Perhaps uphill isn’t always the harder choice.
    <br><br>
    Once we entered the forest, the scenery became monotonous. For someone unfamiliar with plants and animals, like me, all I could do was passively admire the surroundings. Terry, accompanied by Berny, led the group from the front, while Ariel and I lingered far behind, chatting along the way. Despite Terry’s frequent claims of being old and slow on climbs, his pace always struck me as incredibly steady. What amazed me most was how effortless he made it seem — he moved ghostlike, calm and composed, covering great distances without breaking a sweat. Watching him reminded me of a hiking friend’s complaints about the damage caused by heavy-footed trekkers and of the training sessions where I learned that light, steady steps are key to protecting the environment. I often pay attention to how I and my companions walk, hoping to maintain this mindfulness. Among all my hiking partners, Terry undoubtedly stands out as a role model. Throughout the climb, we kept him in sight but never managed to catch up. Watching the altimeter on my watch tick upwards, I should have felt excited, yet I was struck by a sudden sadness. Just as I was starting to enjoy the steady, soothing ascent, we reached the highest point of Kumokiri Shindō.
    <br><br>
    This journey was like that all along: filled with anticipation for what lay ahead but reluctant to leave each fleeting moment behind. If only time could pause, if only the trail never had to end……
    <br><br>

    </div><br>
    Crossing the highest point, the trail descended gently along the mountainside, leading us into the upper reaches of Sennin-dani. We passed the Sennin Onsen source, crossed a stream below a confluence, and arrived at the Sennin Onsen Hut on the left bank. The map indicated that the hut was closed, but we clung to the faint hope of soaking in a hot spring — until the sight of ruins dashed our dreams. It was noon, so we decided to have lunch there. As usual, Terry cooked noodles, Ariel managed her portions, and I brought out a pack of Taiwanese snacks to share. Sitting in the shade, we gathered around like a family enjoying a cozy meal.
    <br><br>

    </div><br>
    “Are you a family?” Mr. Sasaki had asked us earlier that morning as we prepared to leave Asohara Onsen Hut. I was thinking how wonderful it would be if we were. Sharing a passion with one’s family and maintaining enthusiasm and health into old age is one of life’s greatest treasures. While we aren’t actually family, having friends like this in life is rare and worth cherishing. As long as we walk these trails together, in these shared moments, we are an irreplaceable family to each other.
    <br><br>
    After resting for over an hour, we resumed our climb upstream along Sennin-dani. This section offered more memorable scenery than Kumokiri Shindō. With little vegetation to block the view, the landscape opened up as we ascended, revealing the peaks of Kurobe Gorge’s right bank. Clear streams ran beside us, while the grassy slopes and shrubs glowed vibrant green under the sun. Among the lush flora, purple alpine elms, white hemlock parsley, and yellow ligularia stood out. The stone textures felt so vivid, as if we were kissing the earth itself. The wind carried the freshness of spring, the warmth of summer, and the crispness of autumn. We rolled up our pants and dipped our legs into the icy creek, savoring another timeless moment of pure bliss.

    </div><br>
    The final ascent was up a loose scree slope, marking the very headwaters of Sennin-dani. Here, we took our last break, with Ariel offering M&M’s to replenish Berny’s lost energy.
    <br><br>
    At nearly 4 PM, we reached the broad ridge with light steps. The interplay of forest and grasslands led to a flat wooden path, and at the end of the trail stood Sennin-ike Hutte. The afternoon sunlight illuminated the hut’s entrance, streaming through glass windows into the cozy wooden lounge filled with books and photographs.
    <br><br>

    </div><br>
    “You can bathe today!” Learning this upon check-in was a delightful surprise. Despite expecting water shortages on the ridge, we discovered a large tub of hot water awaiting us. Though not a shower, it was enough to soak and relax. After taking turns freshening up, we enjoyed dinner as the sun set. The meal included silky tofu paired with savory braised pork, golden pumpkin slices, pickled burdock strips, and unlimited refills of tofu miso soup. The highlight, however, was the fresh sashimi served in small porcelain dishes — a marvel to savor deep in the mountains.
    <br><br>

    </div><br>
    After dinner, we headed to Sennin Pond to watch the sunset. This spot, renowned for its views of the Tateyama Range, was what Terry and Berny had most anticipated. Standing by the pond, we were awestruck by the majestic beauty of Tsurugi-dake, its rugged silhouette mirrored in the still water. As the sun set behind Masago-dake (Mount Masago), Tsurugi-dake became a sharp, dark silhouette, its jagged ridges and massive form seeming to tear at the soul of anyone who gazed at it.
    <br><br>
    That night, I quietly watched Tsurugi-dake from the window. Reflecting on my past nights in the mountains, this moment stood out as one of the most solitary yet fulfilling of my life. Amid the vastness of nature, I felt both unmoored and embraced by the universe.
    <br><br>

    </div><br>
    I am, and will always be, that drifting soul — shapeless, formless, belonging to the boundless wild. An intangible, formless being, yet confined within a fragile, finite shell. Though I cannot manifest in the mortal world, I find solace in this dark room, shared with dear companions.
