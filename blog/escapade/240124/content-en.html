    Although Sennin Pond sits at an altitude of over 2,000 meters, the night was not as cold as one might imagine. During this midsummer season, a thin blanket was enough for a comfortable night’s sleep. We woke at 4:30 in the morning to witness the mirror-like reflection of Tsurugi-dake in Sennin Pond under the glow of dawn. As the sun rose slowly, the jagged peaks of Tsurugi-dake and the Yatsumine Ridge turned a dazzling golden hue from top to bottom. Known as the “Mountain of the Devil” in Japan’s mountaineering community, Tsurugi-dake’s grandeur was unfolding before our eyes in real time.

    From Sennin Pond, we officially stepped into the long-awaited Ura-Tsurugi.
    <br><br>
    Ura-Tsurugi refers to the less-explored side of Tsurugi-dake, compared to the more accessible face overlooking Murodō in the Tateyama area. It encompasses the northern tributaries of Tsurugi-sawa, including the San-no-Mado Glacier, the upstream Komado Glacier, the Yatsumine Ridge on the right bank of San-no-Mado Glacier, and the northern ridge connecting the Chinne, Komado-no-Ō (the main peak of Komado), and Ike-no-Taira-yama (Mount Ike-no-Taira). Situated on the border between Kurobe and Ura-Tsurugi, Sennin Pond offers an unparalleled vantage point to take in the beauty of Ura-Tsurugi.
    <br><br>
    In addition to the natural landscapes immortalized in photography, Sennin-ike Hutte itself holds a unique place in the history of exploration and development in the Kurobe and Tateyama regions. Though rarely mentioned, its story deserves recognition.
    <br><br>
    According to the Kitanippon Shimbun (Northern Japan News Agency), which published a two-year series titled “<a href="http://www.kitanippon.co.jp/pub/hensyu/2001/21c/" target="_blank">A Gift for the 21st Century</a>” in 2001, Sennin-ike Hutte was originally known as the Oiwake Hut, located on a trail between Bijodaira and Midagahara. In 1956, the opening of the highland bus route to Oiwake caused a decline in visitors, leading to the closure of the hut. The then-owner, Mr. Shitaka Shimasa, decided to relocate the hut to Sennin Pond, reopening it two years later. Since then, it has stood in operation for over 65 years. Made entirely of wood, the hut’s survival in such a remote and harsh mountain environment is nothing short of a miracle. However, the building is not in good condition: walking inside causes the floors and walls to creak under strain, and the entire structure leans slightly. In a travel program we watched at Asohara Onsen Hut earlier, there was an interview with Shitaka’s wife, Shizuyo, and their grandson Masahiro, the current caretaker. They expressed their heartfelt wish to repair the leaning hut so that it could continue serving mountaineers — a testament to the spirit passed down through generations. It was deeply moving.
    <br><br>
    Whether it’s the breathtaking landscapes or the warmth of the people, the charm of Sennin Pond is like a trap that holds travelers in its grasp. After breakfast, we packed our gear but couldn’t resist returning to the pond to brew coffee, lingering until the very last moment before finally setting off.
    <br><br>

    </div><br>
    Bidding farewell to Masahiro and the staff, we passed through dense vegetation and stepped onto an open wooden path. With Tsurugi-dake before us, we embarked with eager anticipation.
    <br><br>
    We didn’t plan to climb Tsurugi-dake directly from Ura-Tsurugi, as all the routes require technical skills and equipment far beyond our capabilities. As mentioned before, our real interest was in Chōjirō-dani, so today’s goal was to descend from Sennin Pond to Masago-sawa (Masago River) Lodge.
    <br><br>
    During the planning phase, I noticed that the route from Sennin Pond via Sennin Shindō to the confluence of the streams, and then up Tsurugi-sawa to Masago-sawa Lodge, would take only about two and a half hours. Even adding a round trip to Taira Pond (Taira-no-ike), the total time would be only four hours, which seemed too short. I began researching further and discovered that Tsurugi-sawa Kita-mata (North Fork) was passable. Recently, the caretaker of Ike-no-Taira Hut had even surveyed the area and shared a video online. I quietly added this non-traditional route to the plan, intending to discuss the possibility with Terry later. For a while, I forgot about it — until one day Terry emailed me, saying he planned to explore an old mine near Taira Pond. The email included a video of another mountaineer visiting the abandoned mine, bringing the idea back to life.
    <br><br>
    Located on the eastern slope of Mount Ike-no-Taira (formerly called “West Sennin Mountain”), the mining area known as Kurobe Mine was once Japan’s foremost source of molybdenum. According to the records compiled by the caretaker of Ike-no-Taira Hut, demand for molybdenum during wartime and the early post-war years was so high that, despite the mine’s difficult conditions and high transportation costs, it accounted for three-quarters of Japan’s production. However, as market demand decreased, the mine was abandoned before being fully exploited. Rock fragments containing suspected veins of ore still remain scattered around the area. The unstable terrain near the mine’s entrance, located next to Komado Glacier, frequently experiences rockfalls and is prone to accidents, making exploration challenging for most hikers. However, even near Ike-no-Taira Hut, formerly the office and canteen, one can find fragments of molybdenum ore — a testament to its history.
    <br><br>
    Before leaving Sennin Pond, we asked Masahiro about the condition of the old mine route and Kita-mata. However, he seemed unaware of these paths, so we decided to evaluate as we walked. Based on records, the route wasn’t too difficult, but our main concern was the melting and collapse of the Kita-mata Glacier. Regardless, we decided to carry full packs to Taira Pond. With plenty of time to spare, we could always return via Sennin Shindō if the route proved impassable.
    <br><br>

    It took only 15 minutes to reach Sennin Pass from the hut. Standing there, the enormous, rugged figure of Tsurugi-dake dominated the entire mountain pass, appearing both imposing and unreachable. Rising abruptly from the gentle grassy slopes, the sheer rock face seemed to reach the heavens, reminiscent of the Tower of Babel — not one built by humans, but one that had once been humanity’s Tower of Babel.
    <br><br>
    In the historical backdrop of “Tsurugidake: Ten no Ki,” the first ascent of Tsurugi-dake was seen as an unparalleled honor. For both the mountaineering community and the Land Survey Department, reaching its summit symbolized humanity’s conquest of nature — a testament to skill and power. This reminded me of the biblical story: “They said, ‘Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves and not be scattered over the face of the whole earth.’ But the Lord said, ‘If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them. Let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other.’”
    <br><br>
    In Genesis, God disrupted the construction of the Tower of Babel — a symbol of humanity’s hubris — forcing people to confront the futility of conquest and embrace diversity instead. Similarly, in “Tsurugidake: Ten no Ki,” while the survey team was the first to summit Tsurugi-dake and establish a triangulation point, their rivalry with the mountaineering team transformed into mutual respect. They came to appreciate each other’s perspectives and the deeper meaning of their interaction with the mountain. This shared understanding ultimately lent the story greater emotional resonance.
    <br><br>
    Perhaps we’ve all asked ourselves during a climb: Why do we climb? What is its purpose? We pursue recognition to mask our fears, yet it never satisfies the void within. What we truly need is reconciliation with ourselves. As Jacques Derrida said, “To remember failure is not itself a failure; it is a recognition of difference.” This echoes the message of the Bible: redemption through forgiveness.

    </div><br>
    Suddenly, a cool breeze from the mountain pass pulled me from my thoughts. Watching my companions ahead, I felt like a fleeting mayfly or a speck in the vast ocean. I understood that climbing Tsurugi-dake was merely a way to satisfy my curiosity about the world. Everything I would experience was but one of infinite possibilities — both as weighty as Mount Tai and as light as a feather.
