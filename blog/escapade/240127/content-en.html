    I remember Ariel asking me after the trip, “Which day of the Tsurugi-dake climb left the deepest impression on you?” At the time, I felt every day was unique and filled with rare experiences, making it impossible to single out just one. But now, if I were asked which part of the journey I enjoyed the most, the answer would undoubtedly be the third day — crossing Sennin Pass, entering Ike-no-Taira, and venturing into Tsurugi-sawa Kita-mata. It was during this time that we truly delved into Ura-Tsurugi. This place seemed to possess a magical power to make time and space irrelevant, allowing me to completely detach from worldly worries and entanglements. In those moments, I felt I was fighting solely for myself, living entirely for myself.

    After crossing Sennin Pass, Tsurugi-dake came into constant view, and the scenery of Ura-Tsurugi unfolded before us without reservation. The red-roofed Ike-no-Taira Hut sat perched on a saddle, seemingly isolated from the world. The charming Taira Pond adorned the green slopes where grasslands and forests intertwined, while the ominous Tsurugi-dake loomed above, turning the area into a surreal paradise. We followed a contour path along the slopes to the western side of Sennin Mountain and soon reached the hut. Ike-no-Taira Hut was quiet, surrounded by adult-height stone walls that felt reassuringly sturdy. Behind it was the eastern face of Ike-no-Taira-yama, a colorful and imposing rock wall plunging steeply into the headwaters of Kurobe Mine Valley. In front of the hut, facing Taira Pond, was a wooden bench. Sitting there, looking up at Tsurugi-dake, felt like arriving at the gateway to the celestial realm, inspiring a reverent urge to kneel in awe.

    We didn’t enter the hut and weren’t sure if it was manned, though earlier we had encountered several mountaineers heading toward Sennin Pond. Perhaps they were guests from the previous night? We couldn’t tell. As the sunlight grew more intense, the harsh UV rays left us dazed. We sought temporary respite under a canvas shelter beside the hut but couldn’t escape the oppressive heat. Before leaving, we took turns ringing the blessing bell in front of the hut, praying for everyone’s safety as we climbed higher and descended safely.
    <br><br>
    Terry forged ahead and quickly reached Taira Pond. Ariel and Berny followed, while I lingered far behind, trying to capture as much as I could through the camera lens and store it in my memory card. I thought the view from Ike-no-Taira Hut couldn’t be surpassed, but Taira Pond proved me wrong — it was yet another hidden gem! Unlike Sennin Pond, which maintained a “safe distance” from Tsurugi-dake, allowing for a broad and objective perspective, Taira Pond offered a closer and more intimate view. Although the scope was narrower, the details of the mountain’s texture, rock layers, and vegetation were more vivid and profound. The interplay of light and shadow on the sunlit slopes, mirrored in the pond alongside the bright blue sky, drew us across the marshy grassland to the water’s edge. The path leading to Kita-mata was on the opposite side of the pond, so we had to retrace our steps and cross the marsh again to reach the outer trail. At that moment, Terry was already on the far side of the pond. Watching him alone amidst the majestic scenery, his figure seemed so small that it filled me with a deep sense of reverence for nature.

    The trail toward Kita-mata was challenging right from the start. We followed trail markers and pushed through dense bushes, which felt reminiscent of hiking in Taiwan. After a short while, the path widened, and the vegetation showed signs of recent clearing, with cut branches scattered underfoot. Walking over them was a bit slippery and unstable, but we were glad not to have to crouch and dodge obstacles. As we descended further, the trees thinned, opening up the view. The sunlight beating down on us was relentless, making us sweat profusely. Around a bright and glaring bend, we found ourselves face-to-face with the Kita-mata Glacier.
    <br><br>

    The last stretch before reaching the glacier was a steep scree slope with loose rocks. Initially, there was a Prusik core for assistance, which, though dynamic, helped with balance. Below the winter snowline, however, there were no ropes, and the eroded slopes were extremely fragile. Each step sent pebbles and gravel tumbling down, forcing us to space out and avoid stepping on the same path to prevent rockfalls from cascading like bowling balls into the glacier. Despite our caution, I was hit on the ankle by a rock the size of a fist just before reaching the glacier surface. Luckily, my boots provided protection, leaving only a small bruise the size of a thumb with no serious injury.

    Setting foot on the glacier felt surreal. Although it wasn’t my first time on a glacier or the most spectacular one I’d seen, it was the first time I reached one after several days of hiking and living outdoors, carrying all my gear. The exhilaration was unmatched. Due to the heat, the ice surface was wet and sticky, making it tricky to find a spot to sit and put on crampons. Observing the conditions earlier, we had already noted that the remaining ice surface wasn’t long, so crampons might not be strictly necessary. However, we decided to use this stretch as practice to familiarize ourselves with the equipment in preparation for the following day’s climb on Chōjirō Glacier.
    <br><br>
    The final section of the glacier looked solid but was actually hollow, with a rushing stream beneath the ice. Just upstream, large sections of the ice had collapsed, leaving cracks and thinning bridges only a few centimeters thick, constantly on the verge of breaking. Downstream, the glacier ended abruptly with a two-story drop into a narrow canyon, where freezing, turbulent water crashed against rocks with a deafening roar. Fortunately, we found a sturdy section of ice with just enough space for two people to stand. I jumped down first to transfer the gear, and the others followed, one by one. Eventually, we all made it safely to the creek bed.

    In winter, the glacier extends down to the confluence near Futa-mata (the two forks junction), allowing for an easy walk on flat ice surfaces without the challenges of steep drops or swift currents. However, in summer, the melting snow exposes rocks and raises water levels, making crossings arduous if a good path isn’t found. Still, summer has its perks, like the endless supply of sweet, cold snowmelt — an exceptional treat in my hiking experiences. Terry likened this valley to Alishan’s Boboyou Stream, and I couldn’t agree more. Not only were the landscapes similar, but the physical and technical demands were as well. Both streams have given me unforgettable and cherished memories.

    At 10:30 a.m., we reached the confluence of San-no-Mado Glacier.
    <br><br>
    Due to the terrain, San-no-Mado Glacier receives little sunlight, allowing the ice to extend downward into the northern tributaries. The valley ended at a two-story ice wall that blocked the sunlight. As it was still early in the day and we had only a short distance left, we decided to take a lunch break on the flat area beneath the ice wall.
