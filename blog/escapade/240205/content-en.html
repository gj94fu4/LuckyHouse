    From the confluence, we looked up at Tsurugi-dake, where the San-no-Mado Glacier stretched in a near-straight line toward the saddle on the ridge. Its steep slope was awe-inspiring, with folds and crevices shaped by repeated thawing, freezing, and slow movement — a testament to the constant battle between gravity and friction. In a way, mountaineering is a game of this same balance between gravity and friction. The same can be said for the very existence of mountains, rivers, forests, and air. As we soaked our feet in the stream, listening to echoes of falling rocks from distant valleys and watching chunks of ice break from the glacier’s edge, we momentarily connected our fleeting lives to the eternal rhythms of nature.

    Reaching Futa-mata brought mixed feelings. On the one hand, being back on the popular route was reassuring, as it meant fewer unknown risks. On the other hand, it marked our return to the fringes of civilization, where we could no longer fully immerse ourselves in solitude and nature.

    The trail beyond Futa-mata followed the Tsurugi-sawa Minami-mata (South Fork) upstream. Initially, I thought the mainstream trail would be straightforward, but shortly after crossing the bridge, we encountered a section requiring us to grip iron chains and step on metal rungs to traverse a sheer rock face above the roaring river.

    The Tsurugi-sawa Minami-mata watershed is much larger than the Kita-mata, encompassing tributaries like Chōjirō-dani, Heizō-dani (Heizō Valley), Musashi-dani (Musashi Valley), Betsuzan-sawa (Betsuzan Stream), and Masago-sawa, stretching from Tsurugi-dake to Masago-dake (Mount Masago). Naturally, the water volume was far greater and more forceful. We trudged forward under the relentless sun, each step a slow battle against the heat. The deafening roar of the river drowned out all other sounds, creating an almost desert-like solitude that left our skin scorched and our throats parched. When we finally found a patch of shade, it felt like discovering an oasis. Ariel and I jumped down to the water, filling our bottles and gulping the refreshing liquid without hesitation.

    After passing the trail junction to Kuranosuke-daira, the surrounding terrain became increasingly barren. Sunlight reflected off the rocks, striking us from all directions, as if we were in an oven set to roast us completely. Time seemed to slow to an unbearable crawl. Each drop of sweat falling through the air seemed suspended, and checking my watch every half hour revealed that only ten minutes had passed. The short 1.5-hour journey from Futa-mata to Masago-sawa Lodge felt like an entire afternoon.

    Masago-sawa Lodge appeared like a fortress in the desert, with high stone walls that looked impenetrable, as though even a 120mm smoothbore cannon couldn’t breach them. We climbed the stone steps to check in at the front desk and were then shown to single-person cubicles partitioned by standardized wooden panels. It felt cold and isolating. Tonight was the only place on our itinerary where we expected to shower, and the lodge didn’t disappoint. The bathrooms were remarkably luxurious for a mountain hut, featuring proper showerheads, a plastic bathtub, and a setup that felt like being back in a city hotel. By 3 p.m., we had all showered, washed our clothes, and hung them out to dry on the fortress walls under the sun.

    Berny and I grabbed beers and headed to the outdoor rest area under a canvas tent. Lounging in loose shorts and T-shirts, leaning against cheap plastic chairs and tables, I was struck by the sensation of being on a holiday beach. Suddenly, I remembered we hadn’t explored the old mining tunnel. Did we forget, or had Terry decided against it after assessing the situation? Judging by the time we arrived at the lodge, we could easily have managed the detour. Perhaps, back at Sennin-ike, our minds were preoccupied with whether the Kita-mata was passable, and Terry wanted to save the mining tunnel as a backup plan in case we needed to turn back.
    <br><br>
    Regardless, we spent the rest of the afternoon relaxing until the lodge owner loudly announced that dinner was ready.
